            <p class="mb-0">In tenth grade I got admitted into Monroe Technology Center for the Health and Medical Sciences program. This program is located at Inova Cornwall hospital where I went every other day for 7 hours. While a majority of the people are juniors when accepted, I was accepted as a sophomore.
              <h4>Year one</h4>
              We learned medical terminology and we got a close look at all the systems in the body. Also, we shadowed many doctors and professions in the medical field such as, doctors in the emergency room, physical therapists, dialysis nurses, and radiologists.
              <h4>Year two</h4>
              Three years ago, I took Radiology. In this class we learned about all the systems, diseases and bones in the body, and all the common procedures in healthcare. Through this class, we got to visit a cadaver lab and watch a triple bypass surgery and apply what we learn to real life experiences. I was also able to get many certifications such as NOCTI, Workplace Readiness, CPR, First aid, and OSHA.
            <h4>Year three</h4>
              Two years ago I took pharmacy and we learned about 300 hundred most commonly used drugs, how they are used and side effects. I am a licensed pharmacy technician and did so by taking the national certification exam.

            <p class="mb-0">I started off as a bioinformatics major and quickly learned that this would not be the best major to help me get to my career goal. I then switched to a BIS degree at NJIT. Finally I am a Health Management degree at SLU. I am an active member of my college community.
              I am on the executive board as a public relations officer for minds matter which is a mental health awareness awareness club on campus. I am also in a string quartet called all strings attached.
              I am in the society of musical arts as well. I take part in a religious organization on campus known as the BAPS campus
              fellowship. I have a 3.5 GPA and strive to keep my grades as high as possible.
              I had an internship with the SRL group as a data analyst and miner.
              I then started doing little freelance graphic designing.
              Currently I am on track to graduate in four more semesters and I hope to land a job in the healthcare management field.</p>
