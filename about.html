              </h2>
              <p>My name is Pari Patel and I am a sophomore at NJIT majoring in Business and Information systems. I grew up in a town near Tampa, FL. I attempted to do everything when I was little from sports to art but my major interest was music. I didnâ€™t discover orchestra until 6th grade, but even before that, I loved listening to music and creating beats of sorts on my own. I taught myself how to play the cello and a classical Indian drum set known as the tabla. Throughout my life, school, family and religion have always been my priorities.  </p>
              <p class="mb-0">I am a sophomore at NJIT majoring in Business and Information systems. I plan to work in
                the hospital setting as a Health administrator. I would like to complete a masters in this field. I have always been
                interested in the healthcare field and throughout my highschool career I shadowed many possibilities in
                the healthcare clinical and non clinical. I was very interested in the clinical portion of medicine and
                devoted much time and studies into the subject. During this time period, I also was the manager of a
                socio-spiritual organization chapter near where I lived. I managed all the girls activities and classes
                that happened and was responsible for many things. Both of these in my first year of college helped me
                realize that I have an inclination towards management and that I would do well in a management position
                in a setting I enjoy: Health administration.</p>
