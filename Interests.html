              </h2>
              <p>All throughout high school, I started a small business based in my home. I taught people of all ages how to play the traditional Indian instrument called the Tabla. Every Sunday I had about 5 students and I would teach them how to play. By the time they were done with my class, they would be proficient players ready to take an advanced course.</p>

              <p>I made this opportunity for myself because I started this class as soon as I moved to Virginia. Previously, I lived in Florida where I had many connections and where I learned how to play this instrument. I believe in working hard so as soon as I moved, I created this small business and advertised at local religious places, the library, and other public areas. I charged the students 15 dollars an hour which for music lessons by a teenager is a competitive price. Every week I would make 150 dollars which is more money and fewer hours than most high school jobs.</p>
              <p>My odds were quite great because I had no experience in business or teaching and I didn't know anyone so I was able to overcome these battles and have a successful business. How I overcame these battles was just pushing hard and working towards my goals without any other thought. Actually, through this business, I met an individual who was being bullied in one of her middle school classes and she would talk to me about her problems. I got an idea for a local program for these kids that would help them with similar problems.</p>
              <p> So, when I was a junior in high school, two middle schoolers and I created a community program called Emotion Notion. The other two on our team would recruit and I would plan. We noticed that many adolescents had problems in school, work, relationships with people, and sometimes family life. We narrowed down the reasons of why these things could be happening and our conclusion was self-esteem. When these young adults feel like they can’t do things, they don’t!</p>
              <p>We created a program that enables these students to increase their self-esteem through weekly meetings and activities. In Emotion Notion, we research methods of increasing self-esteem and implement solutions through activities, such as group discussions, community activities, and discovering talents.</p>
              <p>We had group discussions about how they felt during the week and how they solved their problems. We give them situations that they can encounter and see what creative solutions they can think of. We did many community activities such as walkathons and volunteering together as a group to boost morale. We also did many activities that helped them find and share their talents like talent shows, arts and crafts, baking, and sports events.</p>
              <p>I truly believe I am able to jump hurdles in my life and help others with theirs as well. The impact of both teaching music and Emotion Notion my life is great because I know I can help others and this gives me the drive to move forward.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>We lived a very simple life, only carrying a small suitcase and backpack with only the bare necessities. I was put into daunting situations I never could have even imagined being in. I was able to see all walks of life from extreme poverty to extreme luxury. This summer, through the place I volunteer at, I had the ability to spend a month in India. I traveled the north, west, and south. I would have four hours of sleep at night and seven-hour bus rides almost every day. I washed my clothes by hand and brushed using water bottles. The trip was difficult yet enlightening. I've realized I live a life drastically better and different than most of the world. Even the poorest of the poor smiled and waved when we passed by.</p>
                <p>The goal of this trip was to grow. I came back with a bigger heart, a more open mind and a new willingness to find and take all the opportunities I have. Regardless of the socio-economical background, where I was in India or what language was spoken if I needed help with anything, I could find it. I would like to carry this trait with me everywhere. I realized there are huge problems in the world that need to be solved so to let go of the little things that don't really matter. Don't worry if things don't go my way just know everything will be okay. Lastly, I'd like to reach my full potential and do the most I can for myself and others because I have the ability to do whatever I put my mind to. I learned that when life brings opportunities, take them because there are plenty of people out there that don't have any means of education or work. I am thankful for the life I have in America: the food that I have to sustain myself, clean water whenever I please, and facilities to ensure my physical and mental growth.</p>
                <p>After this trip I realized I needed to move forward in life at all times as a student, a daughter, a sister, a mentor, an employee and as a citizen. As a student I decided to look for more opportunities beyond the education I am receiving right now to get ahead in my career goal. As a daughter and sister, I’ve learnt to appreciate my family and everything they do for me more. As a mentor I’d like my mentees to be inspired by the true person I am and not the superficial things that they may be looking at. As an employee I’d like to bring more to the company and be an asset to them. Lastly as a citizen, I will be more engaged with our community and whatever communities I am a part of and devote some more of my time to the greater good.</p>
